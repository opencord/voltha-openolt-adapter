      "message": "This patch itself is great. But this will break all the hardware tests with RadiSys, Edgecore and Adtran OLTs if this merges because we have not yet updated the debian packages for all these OLTs. This brings in an incompatible API change, so we need to hold on for some time until it is communicated to all stake holders. For Edgecore it is easy for me update the deb package on the OLTs. But for RadiSys and Adtran OLTs, they are currently generated by them.",
