      "message": "When the OLT is admin DOWN all the indications will be ignored from the adapter. So the adapter has to notify child devices explicitly .As of now , current code is not sending any messages to child devices on OLT disable since olt_indication is also getting ignored. It just updates the connection state of it from core.\nAnd Dostatedown is a state maintained to handle OLT unreachability i think .",
