# How to Build the Golang based OpenOLT Adapter

## Working with Go Dependencies
This project uses Go Modules https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules to manage
dependencies. As a local best pratice this project also vendors the dependencies.
If you need to update dependencies please follow the Go Modules best practices
and also perform the following steps before committing a patch:
```bash
go mod tidy
go mod verify
go mod vendor
```

## Building with a Local Copy of `voltha-protos` or `voltha-lib-go`
If you want to build/test using a local copy or `voltha-protos` or `voltha-lib-go`
this can be accomplished by using the environment variables `LOCAL_PROTOS` and
`LOCAL_LIB_GO`. These environment variables should be set to the filesystem
path where the local source is located, e.g.

```bash
LOCAL\_PROTOS=$HOME/src/voltha-protos
LOCAL\_LIB\_GO=$HOME/src/voltha-lib-go
```

When these environment variables are set the vendored versions of these packages
will be removed from the `vendor` directory and replaced by coping the files from
the specified locations to the `vendor` directory. *NOTE:* _this means that
the files in the `vendor` directory are no longer what is in the `git` repository
and it will take manual `git` intervention to put the original files back._
