      "message": "You probably will have problem to get child device here. Core might not receive the PortCreated from onu-adapter yet to put the child device id into Peers  of port(GetChildDevice iterates on these Peers in Core). You may want to check https://gerrit.opencord.org/#/c/14475 and https://gerrit.opencord.org/#/c/14474/ . If the related patch in  link https://gerrit.opencord.org/#/c/14474/ will be merged, then onu_device  will be returned in the response of child_device_detected. After these two patches are merged, we may reflect them to here also.",
