One way to that is to still fetch the list of key/value with rsrcMgr.KVStore.List(ctx, path) and use the key from the list to clear the entries in the cache, while use the rsrcMgr.KVStore.DeleteWithPrefix with the entire data.",

At the time we clear the UNI ports, we dont have the vlan and priority fields. \nWe may try to iterate over the map and find the related entries and delete those. Is that a good idea?",
