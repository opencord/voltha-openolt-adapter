      "message": "HI Serkant,\nThe idea is to handle when the ip of a OLT is changed, but not the OLT itself. Yes if there is any different OLT with same ip that check should be done, most probably this check is already done in core. but if there is any change in OLT with same ip the NB applications should take care of it",

      "message": "Thanks Abhilash. Now I better understand the use case. How can we make sure if the given IP address is for the same OLT? I\u0027m not sure if this is handled in core. \nThis operation can be dangerous if someone enters an IP address that hits a different existing OLT and can mess up the 2 OLTs at the same time, which is hard to recover. I strongly suggest putting a protection mechanism in the core or in the adapter.",

      "message": "Thanks, Abhilash. I think even if the core checks if there is already a known OLT with the given IP address, the OLT might be connected to another voltha stack and the current core can not know about the existence of the OLT. So the check doesn\u0027t work for all the cases.\nIt might be possible to check if the given IP address and the old IP address have the same device serial number. Implementation could be tricky and I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s possible. I\u0027m marking this as +1 and let\u0027s discuss if we can find a better way of handling this case.",
