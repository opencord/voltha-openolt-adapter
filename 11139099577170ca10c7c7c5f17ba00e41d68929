      "message": "instead of doing this here, coudl you move this to the startCollector method ? it seems useful just there and I\u0027d avoid locking at startup, this method shoudl be done as soon as possibile. Also why are you setting the ACTIVE state ?  that should be done by the core and you shoudl be able just to query the state in the startCollector method without having to lock and/or clone",

      "message": "Thank you for the comments. When I was checking the device operational state in startCollector method, it was coming as ACTIVATING although it was actually ACTIVE as per voltctl device list. It seems that the operational status is not getting updated in openolt-adapter. Hence we made the changes like this.\n\nWe have modified the code as per your suggestions wherein we are not explicitly updating the device state, instead we are calling start and stop collector as per device states",
